This repo exists so I can post C problem solutions for questions listed on sites like
'https://www.w3resource.com/c-programming-exercises/basic-declarations-and-expressions/index.php/' 
as I learn. If you happen to be proficient in C feel free to send advice or alternative solutions all
input is welcome.
